Stream Object
---------------------
Data members:
    *   BASS stream object
    *   List of last PING_LIST ping times (PING_LIST being some defined size determined through trial and error)
    *   Critical section for accessing the ping list
    *   Last send time (milliseconds) for ping
    *   Last receive time for ping
    *   Timer
    *   WSABuf for holding data
    *   Socket for sending and receiving pings

The Stream object is responsible for critical sections, etc; its setters and getters will have the critical section
so that no other code must be aware of them
